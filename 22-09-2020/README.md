# TidyTuesday: Himalayan Climbing Expeditions

A (almost) perfect topic to highlight a charity run by a friend of mine:

### Changing Stories

**[Changing Stories](https://changing-stories.org/)** is a non-profit organisation implementing learning initiatives in Nepal.

>  Each year, Changing Stories gives hundreds of kids the opportunity to learn through innovative learning initiatives. Our learning initiatives give kids the opportunity to learn to read, write and do math - and a belief that they can learn. A belief that is the foundation for them to complete an education and create a life better than the one they came from.
